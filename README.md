# TagMedX: Open-Source Medical Image Annotation üè•

TagMedX is an open-source web app built with FastAPI, Next.js, and MySQL, designed for medical image tagging ‚Äì both classification and detection. It's a tool for healthcare professionals, such as doctors and medical experts, to annotate medical images remotely for AI systems. 

## üöÄ  Quickstart

```bash

git clone https://github.com/heyimjustalex/TagMedX.git
cd TagMedX

```
Start without frontend, just backend, DB, and DBAdmin
```bash 
docker-compose up --build
```
Start whole project (with frontend)

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose_all.yml up --build
```

## Project dependencies
- Database -  mysql:8.1.0
- Database Admin Panel - phpmyadmin:5.2.1
- Backend (FastAPI) - python:3.8 - (additional dependencies in ./backend/requirements.txt)
- Frontend (Next.js + TS) -  node:20 - (additional dependencies in ./frontend/package.json)

## Database

SQL file in /DB/setup.sql (with some random data loading). <br> In /DB folder there are also screenshots of scheme and dbdiagram.io code if modification of scheme is needed. <br>
Scheme might also be viewed in PHPMyadmin

### Structure

The structure of the database is as follows:

**User:**
- Fields: id, e_mail, password_hash, name, surname, title, role, description, experience
- Purpose: Represents a doctor or an admin who controls datasets.
- Relationships: 
  - One-to-Many with Membership
  - One-to-Many with Examination

**Group:**
- Fields: id, name, description
- Purpose: Represents a group or team of users that will work on a specific dataset. For example, a group of dentists marking a teeth dataset.
- Relationships: 
  - One-to-Many with Task
  - One-to-Many with Membership

**Membership:**
- Fields: id_user, id_group
- Purpose: Represents the membership of users in groups.
- Relationships: 
  - Many-to-One with User 
  - Many-to-One with Group

**Task:**
- Fields: id, id_group, max_samples_for_user, name, description, type
- Purpose: Represents tasks that are created by users with the role "admin/manager." A Group is linked with Task, allowing a group of doctors to have many tasks assigned. Task is a representation of activity dataset marking.
- Relationships: 
  - Many-to-One with Group
  - One-to-Many with Sample (each task has multiple photos/samples to mark)
  - One-to-Many with Label (a task has some labels assigned by the admin, which doctors can later choose from)

**Sample:**
- Fields: id, id_task, path, format
- Purpose: Represents samples, which contain information about added photos to be examined.
- Relationships: 
  - Many-to-One with Task       

**Examination:**
- Fields: id, id_user, id_sample, to_further_verification, bad_quality
- Purpose: Records information about Sample Examination by User (doctor). It might involve detection or classification. If it's classification, there is just one bounding box (BBox).
- Relationships: 
  - Many-to-One with User
  - Many-to-One with Sample
  - One-to-Many with BBox (during a single Sample Examination by a particular User, they might crop some data on the Sample with one BBox or with many, depending on the type of sample)

**Label:**
- Fields: id, id_task, name, description
- Purpose: Represents labels for tasks that are constrained by the admin/manager who creates the Task.
- Relationships: 
  - Many-to-One with Task
  - One-to-Many with BBox

**BBox:**
- Fields: id, id_examination, id_label, comment, x1, y1, x2, y2
- Purpose: Stores bounding box details. The coordinates x1, y1 represent the bottom-left corner, and x2, y2 represent the top-right corner.
- Relationships: 
  - Many-to-One with Examination
  - Many-to-One with Label

## Backend
### General

Project has hot-reload with Docker and it gets started with compose. Written with FastAPI.

### TODO - Deadline: 2.11.2023 but it would be better to end this part up to 26.10.2023
- Register/Login with JWT (ask @wybieracz how to do it)
- Adding user to a group, getting users that are part of a group
- File (photos) upload (create some new assets folder for uploaded photos) 
- Possibility to print information about photos

### Naming conventions

1. Use typing and linter.
2. Try to stick to PEP8. 

- Methods: snake_case
- Classes: PascalCase

### Project structure

Backend project is divided into 3 main folders: features, models, repositories. Features have user-domain specific folders like groups, users or tasks. Each of these subfolders has it's own controllers, schemas and services. Some facts:
- If you want to make new feature make new folder in feature folder
- Models are mapped to MySQL database entities defined in /DB/setup.sql. Any change made to model any of these means the other needs to be changed.
- Backend is dockerized and avaliable at localhost:8000 (You can test endpoints users/1 or /users)

## Frontend
### General

Project has hot-reload with Docker and it gets started with command:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose_all.yml up --build
```

### Technologies
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- NextUI

### TODO - Deadline: 2.11.2023 but it would be better to end this part up to 26.10.2023
- Main page
- Register/Login Page
- Group page
- Adding user to a group
- File (photos) upload (create some new assets folder for uploaded photos)

### Naming conventions

1. Components functions and files should start with capital letter.
2. Every component file should be in folder with the same name.
3. Component folder should contains no more than 4 files:
  + **component.css** - component styling
  + **Component.tsx** - component
  + **ComponentConsts.ts** - component consts
  + **ComponentUtils.ts** - component utils (functions)

<br>

- Components: camelCase, () => {}
- Functions: camelCase, function() {}
- CSS classes: dash-case (ex. class-name__sub-class--variant)

### Project structure

Frontend source folder is divided into 5 main folders: app, assets, components, consts and types. App folder defines app structure. Assets stores media files. Components contains subfolders with components. Consts folder is intended for global consts and interfaces. Types folder contains `globals.d.ts` file for defining global interfaces and types. Frontend is dockerized and avaliable at localhost:3000.
